OpenVPN
Copyright (C) 2002 James Yonan <jim@yonan.net>

2002.05.22 -- Version 1.2.0

* Added configuration file support via
  the --config option.
* Added pthread support to improve latency.
  With pthread support, OpenVPN
  will offload CPU-intensive tasks such as RSA
  key number crunching to a background thread
  to improve tunnel packet forwarding
  latency.  pthread support can be enabled
  with the --enable-pthread configure option.
  Pthread support is currently available
  only for Linux and Solaris.
* Added --dev-type option so that tun/tap
  device names don't need to begin with
  "tun" or "tap".
* Added --writepid option to write main
  process ID to a file.
* Numerous portability fixes to ease
  porting to other OSes including changing
  all network types to uint8_t and uint32_t,
  and not assuming that time_t is 32 bits.
* Backported to OpenSSL 0.9.5.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Finished OpenBSD port except for
  pthread support.
* Added initialization script:
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init
  (Douglas Keller)
* Ported to Mac OS X (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Improved resilience to DoS attacks when
  TLS mode is used without --remote or
  --tls-auth, or when --float is used
  with --remote.  Note however that the best
  defense against DoS attacks in TLS mode
  is to use --tls-auth.
* Eliminated automake/autoconf dependency
  for non-developers.
* Ported configure.in to configure.ac
  and autoconf 2.50+.
* SIGHUP signal now causes OpenVPN to restart
  and re-read command line and or config file,
  in conformance with canonical daemon behaviour.
* SIGUSR1 now does what SIGHUP did in
  version 1.1.1 and earlier -- close and reopen
  the UDP socket for use when DHCP changes
  host's IP address and preserve most recently
  authenticated peer address without rereading
  config file.
* SIGUSR2 added -- outputs current statistics,
  including compression statistics.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.

2002.04.22 -- Version 1.1.1
	
* Added --ifconfig option to automatically configure
  TUN device.
* Added inactivity disconnect (--inactive
  and --ping-exit options).
* Added --ping option to keep stateful firewalls
  from timing out.
* Added sanity check to command line parser to
  err if any TLS options are used in non-TLS mode.
* Fixed build problem with compiler environments that
  define printf as a macro.
* Fixed build problem on linux systems that have
  an integrated TUN/TAP driver but lack the persistent
  tunnel feature (TUNSETPERSIST).  Some linux kernels
  >= 2.4.0 and < 2.4.7 fall into this category.
* Changed all calls to EVP_CipherInit to use explicit
  encrypt/decrypt mode in order to fix problem with
  IDEA-CBC and AES-256-CBC ciphers.
* Minor changes to control channel transmit limiter
  algorithm to fix problem where TLS control channel
  might not renegotiate within the default 60 second window.
* Simplified man page examples by taking advantage
  of the new --ifconfig option.
* Minor changes to configure.in to check more
  rigourously for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or greater.
* Put back openvpn.spec, eliminated
  openvpn.spec.in.
* Modified openvpn.spec to reflect new automake-based
  build environment (Bishop Clark).
* Other documentation changes.
* Added --test-crypto option for debugging.
* Added "missing" and "mkinstalldirs" automake
  support files.


2002.04.09 -- Version 1.1.0

* Strengthened replay protection and IV handling,
  extending it fully to both static key and
  TLS dynamic key exchange modes.
* Added --mlock option to disable paging and ensure that key
  material and tunnel data is never paged to disk.
* Added optional traffic shaping feature to cap the maximum
  data rate of the tunnel.
* Converted to automake (The Platypus Brothers 2002-04-01).
* Ported to OpenBSD by Janne Johansson.
* Added --tun-af-inet option to work around an incompatibility
  between Linux and BSD tun drivers.
* Sequence number-based replay protection using the
  IPSec sliding window model is now the default,
  disable with --no-replay.
* Explicit IV is now the default, disable with --no-iv.
* Disabled all cipher modes except CBC, CFB, and OFB.
* In CBC mode, use explicit IV and carry forward residuals,
  using IPSec model.
* In CFB/OFB mode, IV is timestamp, sequence number.
* Eliminated --packet-id, --timestamp, and max-delta parameter to
  the --tls-auth option as they are now supplanted by improved
  replay code which is enabled by default.
* Eliminated --rand-iv as it is now obsolete with improved
  IV code.
* Eliminated --reneg-err option as it increases vulnerability
  to DoS attacks.
* Added weak key check for DES ciphers.
* --tls-freq option is no longer specified on the command line,
  instead it now inherits its parameter from the
  --tls-timeout option.
* Fixed bug that would try to free memory on exit that was
  never malloced if --comp-lzo was not specified.
* Errata fixed in the man page examples: "test-ca" should be
  "tmp-ca".
* Updated manual page.
* Preliminary work in porting to OpenSSL 0.9.7.
* Changed license to allowing linking with OpenSSL.

2002.03.29 -- Version 1.0.3

* Fixed a problem in configure with library ordering on the
  command line.

2002.03.28 -- Version 1.0.2

* Improved the efficiency of the inner event loop.
* Fixed a minor bug with timeout handling.
* Improved the build system to build on RH 6.2 through 7.2.
* Added an openvpn.spec file for RPM builders (Bishop Clark).

2002.03.23 -- Version 1.0

* Added TLS-based authentication and key exchange.
* Added gremlin mode to stress test.
* Wrote man page.

2001.12.26 -- Version 0.91

* Added any choice of cipher or HMAC digest.

2001.5.13 -- Version 0.90

* Initial release.
* IP tunnel over UDP, with blowfish cipher and SHA1 HMAC signature.
