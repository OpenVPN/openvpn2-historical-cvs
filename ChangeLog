2003.02.23 -- Version 1.3.2.15

* Added --replay-persist feature to allow replay
  protection across sessions.
* Fixed bug where --ifconfig could not be used
  with --tun-mtu.
* Added --tun-mtu-extra parameter to deal with
  the situation where a read on a TUN/TAP device
  returns more data than the device's MTU size.
* Fixed bug where some IPv6 support code for
  Linux was not being properly ifdefed out for
  Linux 2.2, causing compile errors.
* Added OPENVPN_EXIT_STATUS_x codes to
  openvpn.h to control which status value
  openvpn returns to its caller (such as
  a shell or inetd/xinetd) for various conditions.
* Added OPENVPN_DEBUG_COMMAND_LINE flag to
  openvpn.h to allow debugging in situations
  where stdout, stderr, and syslog cannot be used
  for message output, such as when OpenVPN is
  instantiated by inetd/xinetd.
* Removed owner-execute permission from file
  created by static key generator (Herbert Xu
  and Alberto Gonzalez Iniesta).
* Added --passtos option to allow IPv4 TOS bits
  to be passed from TUN/TAP input packets to
  the outgoing UDP socket (Craig Knox).
* Added code to prevent open socket file descriptors
  from being accessible to called scripts.
* Numerous build system and portability
  fixes (Matthias Andree).
* Added better sensing of compiler support for
  variable argument macros, including (a) gcc
  style, (b) ISO C 1999 style, and (c) no support.
* Removed generated files from CVS.  Note INSTALL
  file for new CVS build commands.
* Changed all internal _* symbols to x_*
  for C standards compliance.

2002.10.23 -- Version 1.3.2

* Added SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list call
  to follow the canonical form for TLS initialization
  recommended by the OpenSSL docs.  This change allows
  better support for intermediate CAs and has no impact
  on security.
* Added build-inter script to easy-rsa package, to
  facilitate the generation of intermediate CAs.
* Ported to NetBSD (Dimitri Goldin).
* Fixed minor bug in easy-rsa/sign-req.  It refers to
  openssl.cnf file, instead of $KEY_CONFIG, like all
  other scripts (Ernesto Baschny).
* Added --days 3650 to the root CA generation command
  in the HOWTO to override the woefully small 30 day
  default (Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer).
* Fixed bug where --ping-restart would sometimes
  not re-resolve remote DNS hostname.
* Added --tun-ipv6 option and related infrastructure
  support for IPv6 over tun.
* Added IPv6 over tun support for Linux (Aaron Sethman).
* Added FreeBSD 4.1.1+ TUN/TAP driver notes to
  INSTALL (Matthias Andree).
* Added inetd/xinetd support (--inetd) including
  documentation in the HOWTO.
* Added "Important Note on the use of commercial certificate
  authorities (CAs) with OpenVPN" to HOWTO based on
  issues raised on the openvpn-users list.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.1

* Fixed bug in openvpn.spec and openvpn.init
  which caused RPM upgrade to fail.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.0

* Added --dev-node option to allow explicit selection of
  tun/tap device node.
* Removed mlockall call from child thread, as it doesn't
  appear to be necessary (child thread inherits mlockall
  state from parent).
* Added --ping-timer-rem which causes timer for --ping-exit
  and --ping-restart not to run unless we have a remote IP
  address.
* Added condrestart to openvpn.init and openvpn.spec
  (Bishop Clark).
* Added --ifconfig case for FreeBSD (Matthias Andree).
* Call openlog with facility=LOG_DAEMON (Matthias Andree).
* Changed LOG_INFO messages to LOG_NOTICE.
* Added warning when key files are group/others accessible.
* Added --single-session flag for TLS mode.
* Fixed bug where --writepid would segfault if used with
  an invalid filename.
* Fixed bug where --ipchange status message was formatted
  incorrectly.
* Print more concise error message when system() call
  fails.
* Added --disable-occ option.
* Added --local, --remote, and --ifconfig options sanity
  check.
* Changed default UDP MTU to 1300 and TUN/TAP MTU to
  1300.
* Successfully tested with OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 2.
* Broke out debug level definitions to errlevel.h
* Minor documentation and web site changes.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0, however default
  MTU changes will require setting the MTU explicitly
  by command line option, if you want 1.3.0 to
  communicate with previous versions.

2002.06.12 -- Version 1.2.1

* Added --ping-restart option to restart
  connection on ping timeout using SIGUSR1
  logic (Matthias Andree).
* Added --persist-tun, --persist-key,
  --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-ip
  options for finer-grained control over SIGUSR1
  and --ping-restart restarts.  To
  replicate previous SIGUSR1 functionality,
  use --persist-remote-ip.
* Changed residual IV fetching code to take
  IV from tail of ciphertext.
* Added check to make sure that CFB or OFB
  cipher modes are only used with SSL/TLS
  authentication mode, and added a caveat
  to INSTALL.
* Changed signal handling during initialization
  (including re-initialization during restarts)
  to exit on SIGTERM or SIGINT and ignore other
  signals which would ordinarily be caught.
* Added --resolv-retry option to allow
  retries on hostname resolution.
* Expanded the --float option to also
  allow dynamic changes in source port number
  on incoming datagrams.
* Added --mute option to limit repetitive
  logging of similar message types.
* Added --group option to downgrade GID
  after initialization.
* Try to set ifconfig path automatically
  in configure.
* Added --ifconfig code for Mac OS X
  (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Moved "Peer Connection Initiated" message
  to --verb level 1.
* Successfully tested with
  OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 1 and AES cipher.
* Added RPM notes to INSTALL.
* Added ACX_PTHREAD (from the autoconf
  macro archive) to configure.ac
  to figure out the right pthread
  options for a given platform.
* Broke out macro definitions from
  configure.ac to acinclude.m4.
* Minor changes to docs and HOWTO.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0.

2002.05.22 -- Version 1.2.0

* Added configuration file support via
  the --config option.
* Added pthread support to improve latency.
  With pthread support, OpenVPN
  will offload CPU-intensive tasks such as RSA
  key number crunching to a background thread
  to improve tunnel packet forwarding
  latency.  pthread support can be enabled
  with the --enable-pthread configure option.
  Pthread support is currently available
  only for Linux and Solaris.
* Added --dev-type option so that tun/tap
  device names don't need to begin with
  "tun" or "tap".
* Added --writepid option to write main
  process ID to a file.
* Numerous portability fixes to ease
  porting to other OSes including changing
  all network types to uint8_t and uint32_t,
  and not assuming that time_t is 32 bits.
* Backported to OpenSSL 0.9.5.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Finished OpenBSD port except for
  pthread support.
* Added initialization script:
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init
  (Douglas Keller)
* Ported to Mac OS X (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Improved resilience to DoS attacks when
  TLS mode is used without --remote or
  --tls-auth, or when --float is used
  with --remote.  Note however that the best
  defense against DoS attacks in TLS mode
  is to use --tls-auth.
* Eliminated automake/autoconf dependency
  for non-developers.
* Ported configure.in to configure.ac
  and autoconf 2.50+.
* SIGHUP signal now causes OpenVPN to restart
  and re-read command line and or config file,
  in conformance with canonical daemon behaviour.
* SIGUSR1 now does what SIGHUP did in
  version 1.1.1 and earlier -- close and reopen
  the UDP socket for use when DHCP changes
  host's IP address and preserve most recently
  authenticated peer address without rereading
  config file.
* SIGUSR2 added -- outputs current statistics,
  including compression statistics.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.

2002.04.22 -- Version 1.1.1
	
* Added --ifconfig option to automatically configure
  TUN device.
* Added inactivity disconnect (--inactive
  and --ping-exit options).
* Added --ping option to keep stateful firewalls
  from timing out.
* Added sanity check to command line parser to
  err if any TLS options are used in non-TLS mode.
* Fixed build problem with compiler environments that
  define printf as a macro.
* Fixed build problem on linux systems that have
  an integrated TUN/TAP driver but lack the persistent
  tunnel feature (TUNSETPERSIST).  Some linux kernels
  >= 2.4.0 and < 2.4.7 fall into this category.
* Changed all calls to EVP_CipherInit to use explicit
  encrypt/decrypt mode in order to fix problem with
  IDEA-CBC and AES-256-CBC ciphers.
* Minor changes to control channel transmit limiter
  algorithm to fix problem where TLS control channel
  might not renegotiate within the default 60 second window.
* Simplified man page examples by taking advantage
  of the new --ifconfig option.
* Minor changes to configure.in to check more
  rigourously for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or greater.
* Put back openvpn.spec, eliminated
  openvpn.spec.in.
* Modified openvpn.spec to reflect new automake-based
  build environment (Bishop Clark).
* Other documentation changes.
* Added --test-crypto option for debugging.
* Added "missing" and "mkinstalldirs" automake
  support files.


2002.04.09 -- Version 1.1.0

* Strengthened replay protection and IV handling,
  extending it fully to both static key and
  TLS dynamic key exchange modes.
* Added --mlock option to disable paging and ensure that key
  material and tunnel data is never paged to disk.
* Added optional traffic shaping feature to cap the maximum
  data rate of the tunnel.
* Converted to automake (The Platypus Brothers 2002-04-01).
* Ported to OpenBSD by Janne Johansson.
* Added --tun-af-inet option to work around an incompatibility
  between Linux and BSD tun drivers.
* Sequence number-based replay protection using the
  IPSec sliding window model is now the default,
  disable with --no-replay.
* Explicit IV is now the default, disable with --no-iv.
* Disabled all cipher modes except CBC, CFB, and OFB.
* In CBC mode, use explicit IV and carry forward residuals,
  using IPSec model.
* In CFB/OFB mode, IV is timestamp, sequence number.
* Eliminated --packet-id, --timestamp, and max-delta parameter to
  the --tls-auth option as they are now supplanted by improved
  replay code which is enabled by default.
* Eliminated --rand-iv as it is now obsolete with improved
  IV code.
* Eliminated --reneg-err option as it increases vulnerability
  to DoS attacks.
* Added weak key check for DES ciphers.
* --tls-freq option is no longer specified on the command line,
  instead it now inherits its parameter from the
  --tls-timeout option.
* Fixed bug that would try to free memory on exit that was
  never malloced if --comp-lzo was not specified.
* Errata fixed in the man page examples: "test-ca" should be
  "tmp-ca".
* Updated manual page.
* Preliminary work in porting to OpenSSL 0.9.7.
* Changed license to allowing linking with OpenSSL.

2002.03.29 -- Version 1.0.3

* Fixed a problem in configure with library ordering on the
  command line.

2002.03.28 -- Version 1.0.2

* Improved the efficiency of the inner event loop.
* Fixed a minor bug with timeout handling.
* Improved the build system to build on RH 6.2 through 7.2.
* Added an openvpn.spec file for RPM builders (Bishop Clark).

2002.03.23 -- Version 1.0

* Added TLS-based authentication and key exchange.
* Added gremlin mode to stress test.
* Wrote man page.

2001.12.26 -- Version 0.91

* Added any choice of cipher or HMAC digest.

2001.5.13 -- Version 0.90

* Initial release.
* IP tunnel over UDP, with blowfish cipher and SHA1 HMAC signature.
