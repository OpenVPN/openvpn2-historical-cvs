Installation Instructions for OpenVPN

REQUIRES:
  (1) Linux Kernel 2.2+ or OpenBSD 3.0+.
  (2) Universal TUN/TAP driver 1.1 as a kernel module or compiled
      into the kernel -- available from http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
      The TUN/TAP driver has been a standard part of the linux kernel
      since the early 2.4 releases, therefore most 2.4 users will find
      this package already installed.  OpenVPN may also be compatible
      with other non-TUN/TAP implementations of virtual tun devices
      available on other unices, but has not yet been extensively tested.
  (3) Gnu make, automake, and autoconf -- available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/
      and is normally included with most Linux distributions.  OpenBSD users
      can easily install them from the "ports" collection.

OPTIONAL (but highly recommended):
  (1) OpenSSL library, necessary for encryption, version 0.9.6 or higher
      required, available from http://www.openssl.org/
  (2) LZO real-time compression library, required for link compression,
      available from http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/

OPTIONAL (for debugging only):
  (1) Dmalloc library
      -- available from http://dmalloc.com/

BUILD commands:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

OPTIONS for ./configure:

--disable-lzo             Do not compile LZO compression support
--disable-crypto          Do not compile OpenSSL crypto support
--disable-ssl             Do not compile OpenSSL SSL support for
                            TLS-based key exchange
--disable-opto            Build without compiler optimizations
--disable-debug           Build without debug info

TUN/TAP Driver Configuration (for the latest version of the driver
	included with Linux 2.4 or higher):

add to /etc/modules.conf: alias char-major-10-200 tun
make device: mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
load driver: modprobe tun
