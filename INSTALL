For the latest version of OpenVPN, go to:

	http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:
  (1) Linux 2.2 or higher.
  (2) OpenBSD 3.0 (experimental).

REQUIRES:
  (1) Linux Kernel 2.2+ or OpenBSD 3.0+ (Though Linux Kernel
      2.4 releases prior to 2.4.7 should be avoided -- see BUGS below).
  (2) Universal TUN/TAP driver 1.1 as a kernel module or compiled
      into the kernel -- available from http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
      The TUN/TAP driver has been a standard part of the linux kernel
      since the early 2.4 releases, therefore most 2.4 users will find
      this package already installed.  OpenVPN may also be compatible
      with other non-TUN/TAP implementations of virtual tun devices
      available on other unices, but has not yet been extensively tested.
  (3) Gnu make, automake, and autoconf
      -- available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/
      and is normally included with most Linux distributions.  OpenBSD
      users can easily install them from the "ports" collection.

OPTIONAL (but highly recommended):
  (1) OpenSSL library, necessary for encryption, version 0.9.6 or higher
      required, available from http://www.openssl.org/
  (2) LZO real-time compression library, required for link compression,
      available from http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/

OPTIONAL (for debugging only):
  (1) Dmalloc library
      -- available from http://dmalloc.com/

BUILD commands:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

OPTIONS for ./configure:

  --disable-lzo             Do not compile LZO compression support
  --disable-crypto          Do not compile OpenSSL crypto support
  --disable-ssl             Do not compile OpenSSL SSL support for
                            TLS-based key exchange
  --with-ssl-headers=DIR    Crypto/SSL Include files location
  --with-ssl-lib=DIR        Crypto/SSL Library location
  --with-lzo-headers=DIR    LZO Include files location
  --with-lzo-lib=DIR        LZO Library location
  --with-leak-check=TYPE    Build with memory leak checking
                            TYPE = dmalloc or ssl

TUN/TAP Driver Configuration:

 Linux 2.4 or higher (with integrated TUN/TAP driver):

  add to /etc/modules.conf: alias char-major-10-200 tun
  make device:              mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
  load driver:              modprobe tun
  enable routing:           echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

 Linux 2.2 or earlier:

  You should obtain
  version 1.1 of the TUN/TAP driver from
  http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
  and follow the installation instructions.

 See the man page for more information and usage examples.

BUGS:

* OpenVPN works fine with the 1.1 TUN/TAP driver in the Linux 2.2 kernels,
  and with the integrated 1.4 TUN/TAP driver in the Linux 2.4 kernels, but
  there's a "gray area" in the 2.4 kernels before 2.4.7 where various
  things may break due to the TUN/TAP driver and other kernel components
  being in a state of flux, so I wouldn't recommend using OpenVPN on these
  kernels unless you are prepared to do some debugging and testing.

* Some problems have been reported in making tunnels between
  Linux and OpenBSD due to incompatibilities in the tun
  implementation on both platforms.
