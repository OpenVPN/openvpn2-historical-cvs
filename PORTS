I think a windows port of OpenVPN would be awesome.

I've written OpenVPN to try to avoid features
that are not standardized well across multiple
OSes such as forking and multi-threading,
so I don't think porting OpenVPN itself will be much
of a problem.  I would probably do it in a weekend
if somebody got the TUN/TAP driver ported over
first. -- James
