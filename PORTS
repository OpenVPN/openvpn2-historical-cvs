OpenVPN
Copyright 2002 by James Yonan <jim@yonan.net>

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

  * Linux 2.2+ (Tested on RedHat 6.2 through 7.2)

  * OpenBSD 3.0 (experimental) -- maintained
    by Janne Johansson <icepic@users.sourceforge.net>

PORTING NOTES:

  * Add platform-specific includes to syshead.h.

  * #ifdef the do_ifconfig() function in misc.c to generate
    a correct "ifconfig" command for your platform.

WISHLIST:

  I think a windows port of OpenVPN would be awesome.

  I've written OpenVPN to try to avoid features
  that are not standardized well across different
  OSes such as forking and multi-threading,
  so I don't think porting OpenVPN itself will be much
  of a problem.  I would probably do it in a weekend
  if somebody got the TUN/TAP driver ported over
  first. -- James
